# Proposal

[Back](/)

While working on other projects, I have found I want to have a fun quiz aspect I can have my users go through to earn different things associated to that project.

For this reason and unable to figure out how to implement it solely into my other projects I figure I can make an api for it to be able to import/utilize it in multiple projects or locations.

This will be stored as nested routes, i.e topic/:name/quiz/:id/question/:id

When working with this API developers shall have the ability to `CREATE`, `READ`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` a quiz in from the API. Allowing their users to the endpoints: `GET` & `POST` and the developers to `PUT` & `DELETE`.
